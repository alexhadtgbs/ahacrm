# ClínicaCRM Development Documentation

## Overview

ClínicaCRM is a Next.js 14 lead management platform for ophthalmology clinics, integrated with Supabase for backend services. The application supports Italian and Spanish locales with dynamic routing under `[locale]`.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSR support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Locales**: Italian (it) and Spanish (es)

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

### 1. Supabase Auth Migration Issues

#### Problem
- Deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package
- Incompatible with Next.js 14 App Router
- Authentication not working properly

#### Solution
- Migrated to `@supabase/ssr` package
- Implemented separate client configurations:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Client-side operations
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side operations  
  - `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Middleware operations

#### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` - New client configuration
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` - New server configuration
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - New middleware configuration

### 2. TypeScript Errors in API Routes

#### Problem
- TypeScript errors with Supabase RPC return types
- Filter argument type mismatches
- Missing type definitions

#### Solution
- Added proper type casting for RPC calls
- Implemented error checking before data processing
- Created comprehensive type definitions in `types/index.ts`

#### Files Modified
- `app/api/cases/route.ts` - Added type casting and error handling
- `types/index.ts` - Comprehensive type definitions

### 3. Dynamic Locale Routing Issues

#### Problem
- 404 errors on dynamic locale routes (`/it/cases`, `/es/cases`)
- Missing layout files for locale structure
- Incorrect folder structure

#### Solution
- Added `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` file
- Verified correct folder structure
- Implemented proper locale detection

#### Files Modified
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - New layout file
- `lib/utils.ts` - Enhanced locale detection

### 4. Next.js Build Warnings

#### Problem
- Unrecognized `appDir` experimental option
- Missing `.next/server/app/not-found_client-reference-manifest.js` files
- Build compilation warnings

#### Solution
- Removed deprecated `appDir` option from `next.config.js`
- Updated Next.js configuration for App Router
- Cleared build cache and restarted development server

#### Files Modified
- `next.config.js` - Removed deprecated options

### 5. Middleware and Edge Runtime Issues

#### Problem
- Middleware using deprecated `edge` runtime instead of `experimental-edge`
- Edge runtime webpack file errors
- Middleware authentication conflicts

#### Solution
- Updated middleware to use `experimental-edge` runtime
- Simplified middleware to handle only locale routing
- Moved authentication logic to client-side

#### Files Modified
- `middleware.ts` - Simplified locale-only routing
- Removed authentication logic from middleware

### 6. React Hydration Warnings

#### Problem
- Mismatched `htmlFor` props between server and client
- Input component generating random IDs
- Hydration mismatch errors

#### Solution
- Implemented React `useId` hook for stable IDs
- Restructured Input component to use fragments
- Used stable ID generation based on `name` and `type`

#### Files Modified
- `components/ui/Input.tsx` - Stable ID generation
- Fixed hydration issues

### 7. Authentication Redirect Loops

#### Problem
- Infinite redirect loops between login and cases pages
- Authentication state fluctuating between `null` and authenticated user
- Multiple `useAuth` hook instances causing conflicts

#### Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was that the `useAuth` hook was being called multiple times (once per page), and each instance was setting up its own auth listener, causing conflicts and state fluctuations.

#### Solution
Implemented a **Singleton Pattern** for authentication state management:

```typescript
// Singleton to manage auth state across components
let authState: {
  user: User | null
  loading: boolean
  initialized: boolean
  listeners: Set<(user: User | null, loading: boolean) => void>
} = {
  user: null,
  loading: true,
  initialized: false,
  listeners: new Set()
}
```

#### Key Changes Made

1. **Singleton Auth State**: Single source of truth for authentication state
2. **Listener Pattern**: Components subscribe to auth state changes
3. **Single Initialization**: Auth is initialized only once
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Listeners are properly removed on unmount

#### Files Modified
- `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Implemented singleton pattern
- `app/[locale]/login/page.tsx` - Added redirect guards
- `app/[locale]/cases/page.tsx` - Added redirect guards

### 8. React Hooks Errors

#### Problem
- "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors
- Conditional hook calls
- Hook order violations

#### Solution
- Ensured hooks are called in the same order every render
- Moved conditional rendering after hooks
- Used proper dependency arrays

#### Files Modified
- `app/[locale]/login/page.tsx` - Fixed hook order
- `app/[locale]/cases/page.tsx` - Fixed hook order

### 9. React State Update Warnings

#### Problem
- "Updating a component during render" warnings
- Router navigation during render

#### Solution
- Moved `router.push` calls into `useEffect` hooks
- Proper state management timing

#### Files Modified
- `app/[locale]/login/page.tsx` - Moved navigation to useEffect
- `app/[locale]/cases/page.tsx` - Moved navigation to useEffect

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Authentication Flow
- **Client-side Protection**: Authentication checks in page components
- **Singleton State**: Single auth state across the application
- **Proper Redirects**: Immediate redirects without delays
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during auth checks

### 2. Error Handling
- **TypeScript Safety**: Proper type checking and casting
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Console Logging**: Debug information for troubleshooting

### 3. Performance
- **Singleton Pattern**: Prevents multiple auth listeners
- **Proper Cleanup**: Memory leak prevention
- **Optimized Renders**: Minimal re-renders

### 4. Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth logic separated from UI
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
- **Modular Components**: Reusable UI components

## Current Application State

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Browser Extension Errors

The following errors in the console are from browser extensions and are **NOT** related to the application:

- LastPass extension errors
- Chrome DevTools extension errors
- Password manager extension errors

These can be safely ignored as they don't affect the application functionality.

## Future Improvements

1. **CSV Export**: Implement case data export functionality
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add Supabase real-time subscriptions
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhanced search and filter capabilities
4. **User Management**: Admin panel for user management
5. **Analytics**: Dashboard with case analytics
6. **Mobile App**: React Native mobile application

## Troubleshooting

### If Authentication Issues Persist
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check Supabase project settings
3. Verify environment variables
4. Restart development server

### If Redirect Loops Occur
1. Check `useAuth` hook implementation
2. Verify redirect guards in pages
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check console for auth state changes

### If Build Errors Occur
1. Clear `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
3. Restart development server

## Conclusion

The application is now stable and production-ready with:
- Robust authentication system
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper error handling
- Type safety
- Responsive design
- Internationalization support

All major issues have been resolved, and the application follows Next.js 14 and Supabase best practices.
